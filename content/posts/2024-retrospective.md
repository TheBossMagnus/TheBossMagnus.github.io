Hey everyone! It's Time for my annual update. I wanted to write more blog posts throughout the year. Sadly, I prefer coding over blogging (and I'm even better at procrastinating). First off, a huge thank you to everyone who's supported my projects. This year has been mind-blowing, with 100,000 downloads across all projects! Never thought I'd reach numbers like that.

## Major Milestones
### Thunder Expansion
The biggest news of 2024? [Thunder is now on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/thunder)! It's been live for a few days for Fabric 1.21.4, and I'm working on releasing it for other Minecraft versions soon. I would like to say that Quilt support is coming too, but there are some technical hurdles to sort out first.

I'm also glad to announce a [partnership with BisectHosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/thebossmagnus) - you can now get reliable server hosting through my affiliate program.

Thunder's gotten way better this year. Sodium 0.6 brought some awesome improvements, especially for translucency sorting. Glass, water, and other transparent stuff look much better now with fewer visual bugs. All while keeping things fast, stable, and simple.

### Behind-the-Scenes
Oh, and there's more about Sodium 0.6 - it added NeoForge support like many other mods did this year. And yeah, that might mean Thunder for NeoForge is in the works... ðŸ˜‰

I switched to [Pakku](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Pakku) for managing Thunder builds, which makes it much easier to handle multiple platforms (like CurseForge and Modrinth) and update to new Minecraft versions. This meant that I Had to completely rework my development tools and systems, but honestly, they needed an overhaul anyway.

## Project Statistics
- Thunder hit 60,000 downloads
- KindaConnected Glass reached 24,000 downloads
- Og Menu Background surprisingly took off with 17,000 downloads

## Personal Growth and Technical Journey
After trying out different Linux distros, I landed on Fedora. Why? It hits the sweet spot - modern packages and an up-to-date desktop while staying reliable. If it's good enough for Linus Torvalds himself, it's good enough for me. It gives me that perfect balance between Windows's "just works" approach and Linux's freedom and power.

I've also started diving into Java, mainly because I wanted to understand Object-Oriented Programming better and maybe get into Minecraft modding someday. In the beginning, Java felt pretty verbose and confusing compared to Python, but I'm starting to see why it's built this way. The structure and robustness make more sense now.

## Looking Forward
Thunder's got some exciting stuff coming in 2025. NeoForge users might want to stay tuned... 

As for Storm? It's on the back burner for now. Maybe someday I'll pick it up again, who knows?

Looking ahead to 2025, I hope you all crush it with your projects and adventures. Whether you're making modpacks, trying to squeeze out more FPS, or just love tinkering with Minecraft, hope the new year brings you all kinds of awesome opportunities.

Stay awesome, keep your render distance high and your FPS even higher! Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰
